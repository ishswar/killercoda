## Introduction

Welcome to this killercoda scenario on building an MCP server in Python using the Server-Sent Events (SSE) protocol.
This tutorial will guide you through creating a Python module that serves as a storytelling tool, accessible to any MCP client, such as a Claud desktop.
By the end of this scenario, you'll have set up an MCP server that provides characters for creating and saving stories in real-time.

### Prerequisites

- Basic knowledge of Python programming.
- Familiarity with HTTP and web servers.

### Scenario Outline

1. **Cloning the GitHub Repository** - Get the provided sample code.
2. **Installing the MCP Module** - Set up the Python environment.
3. **Starting the MCP Server** - Run the pre-configured sample and obtain the endpoint.
4. **Configuring the Cloud Desktop** - Integrate the MCP server with your cloud desktop.
5. **Using the Storytelling Tool** - Test the tool by generating and saving a short story.
