Managing Kubernetes Deployments at Scale with Helmfile

<br>

# Helm files orchestrator - helmfile tool  

Reasons to use Helmfile instead of just Helm when deploying multiple charts:

## Simplified management of multiple releases

Helmfile allows deploying entire environments specified in a simple declarative YAML format. Much easier than running helm install/upgrade commands.
Charts, values, namespaces, etc. can be specified together for the overall environment.
Supports templating to reduce duplication across similar releases.

## Synchronization of releases

Helmfile has primitives like hooks, wait, retries, and timeouts to handle ordering and synchronize releases.
E.g. Wait for a database chart to be up before deploying the backend. Retry failed installations.
Such cross-release coordination is difficult to orchestrate with just Helm.

## Environment separation

Helmfile can maintain different files for dev, staging, prod environments.
Switch environments easily by changing context in a single command.
Helm needs extra scripts and flags to achieve separation between environments.

_In summary, once you reach a certain scale, Helmfile becomes indispensable for managing the complexity of multi-release deployments, release coordination, and multi-environment workflows._

## Install Helmfile  

Installing helmfile is easy - sample steps are like below 

```plain
wget https://github.com/helmfile/helmfile/releases/download/v0.151.0/helmfile_0.151.0_linux_amd64.tar.gz
tar -xvf helmfile_0.151.0_linux_amd64.tar.gz 
mv helmfile /usr/sbin/
```{{exec}}

Af you installed it you can run `version` command to see if it got installed successfully or not 

`helmfile -v`{{exec}}

Sample output 

`helmfile version v0.139.9`

You can now check-out branch `with-helmfile` 

`git checkout with-helmfile`{{exec}}

Under `k8s-specifications` you will find a file named `helmfile.yaml` - if you open it is is very simple like 
** Note ** : File does not need to be called helmfile.yaml - but that is defalut file name that is expected if you want to use your own name you will need to pass flag `--file newname-helmfile.yaml` to provided new name.


```

releases:

- name: db
  chart: db
- name: result
  chart: result
- name: redis
  chart: redis
- name: worker
  chart: worker
- name: vote
  chart: vote
```

What it means is it will deploy all of above charts in order they shows up.
You can also run a command `list` on helmfile to see what all chart 

```
helmfile list
NAME  	NAMESPACE	ENABLED	LABELS	CHART 	VERSION
db    	         	true   	      	db
result	         	true   	      	result
redis 	         	true   	      	redis
worker	         	true   	      	worker
vote  	         	true   	      	vote
```

So above command also shows that helmfile knows what chart to installed and in what order 


## Deploying using helmfile 

Deploying using helmfile is easy; command to initiate deployment is 

```
helmfile sync
```

Sample out put is shown below 
You can see that it installed each helm chart in oder that we defined in `helmfile.yaml`

```

UPDATED RELEASES:

result   result     0.1.0
vote     vote       0.1.0
db       db         0.1.0
```

## Updating value in charts 

After above deployment is suceeds you can check the nodePort used by `vote` chart - you can see it is using default value of `31004` - this value is defined in `chart/values.yaml` file 

```
ubuntu:zhqu-test@3.138.247.64:~/k8s2/example-voting-app/k8s-specifications$kubectl get svc -l app=vote
NAME   TYPE       CLUSTER-IP      EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)          AGE
vote   NodePort   10.104.56.191   <none>        5000:31004/TCP   59m
```

What if you want to update that value - now you don't have to go to that chart and update values.yaml - you can do that rigit from `helmfile.yaml` file 
Below is example that shows how you can provide values for each individual charts 


```
---
releases:

- name: db
  chart: db
- name: result
  chart: result
- name: redis
  chart: redis
- name: worker
  chart: worker
- name: vote
  chart: vote
  values:
   - service:
      nodeport: 31009
```

If you update the value of `helmfile.yaml` with above value and run `helmfile sync` you will see the nodePort for `vote` service will be now using port `31009`

```
kubectl get svc -l app=vote
NAME   TYPE       CLUSTER-IP      EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)          AGE
vote   NodePort   10.104.56.191   <none>        5000:31009/TCP   71m
```

### Multiplue environment 

Going back to our previous example of having one `default` set of values and one for `devlopment` environment setting - how do we do that now in `helmfile` ? 
One way of doing that is to create a 2 go template file ( it's a basically yaml file - but it is porceed by go lang so you can use some go formating/condtioning thee)

Let's create two files called `default.gotmpl` and `env.gotmpl` 

env.gotmpl

```
---
vote:
  service:
    nodeport: "31007"
```

default.gotmpl

```
---
vote:
  service:
    nodeport: "31008"
```

Save them in same directory as where `helmfile.yaml` is present. 

Now update the helmfile.yaml like below 

```
environments:
  default:
   values:
    - default.gotmpl
  dev:
    values:
      - env.gotmpl
---

releases:

- name: db
  chart: db
- name: result
  chart: result
- name: redis
  chart: redis
- name: worker
  chart: worker
- name: vote
  chart: vote
  values:
    - service:
        type: NodePort
        nodeport: {{ .Environment.Values.vote.service.nodeport }}  
```

So - here what we are doing is - we are getting value for nodeport from `.Environment.Values` YAML object. 
Hirarchey after .Environment.Values - is founder inside *.gotmpl found . So kept the same format like before so it start with `vote` then `service` and last the value of `nodeport`

Now we can easily swith between two set of values . 

If we don't give any flag and run `helmfile sync` values will be picked up from `default.gotmpl` 
** Node ** - It is not becuse file is named `default.gotmpl` thus it gets picked up by default. It is becuse in `helmfile.yaml` under environments.default we are using that file thus it gets picked up as defalut values .

Now if you want to swith to usering `Devlopment` environment value we can run same command as above but with addtional `-e` flag

```
helmfile -e dev sync
```

The the wrod `dev` comes from `helmfile.yaml` as there is addtional environment is defined called `dev` and it gets values from `env.gotempl`
If you look at file `env.gotmpl` the value of vote.service.nodeport is defined to be value of 31007 and after above command suceedes if you check the nodePort of vote service it will have value of 31007 - see below 

```
kubectl get svc -l app=vote
NAME   TYPE       CLUSTER-IP      EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)          AGE
vote   NodePort   10.104.56.191   <none>        5000:31007/TCP   88m
```
